# GitNodes

### What is it?

GitNodes is a powerful tool designed to facilitate the creation, management, and collaboration of decentralized collectives. It empowers users to establish self-governing organizations, share data seamlessly, and evolve their projects with ease. GitNodes empowers mission-driven individuals and groups to discover, join, and contribute to a wide variety of projects while fostering transparency and collective ownership. 

### How does it work?

GitNodes is a network of GitHub repositories functioning as decentralized data store for individuals, organizations and communities. This provides complete control and autonomy to their owner(s). The system fosters collective ownership, governance, funding and collaboration while maintaining a level of standardization and structure that allows for interoperability and data sharing between networks, organizations and individuals.

### Why GitHub?

GitHub offers a versatile platform that can serve as a foundation for collectives, as it provides data ownership, collaboration features, and ways to evolve the data of an organization in a transparent way through version control. 

By using GitHub repositories as personal or collective data stores, individuals and collectives can manage their own data, choose between hosting on GitHub or self-hosting, and ensure transparency in their operations. The platform fosters collaboration and openness through features like issues, pull requests, and project boards, while its familiarity and simplicity make it easy for anyone to set up and manage their nodes.
